# swine-flu-vaccines-prediction
This project is a modified group project conducted as part of data analysis competition. Designed to assist health practitioners to proactive planning and targeted interventions in h1n1 flu prevention. The goal is to anticipate the likelihood of individuals getting H1N1 and their yearly flu vaccine. Two probabilities were forecasted: vaccine_h1n1 and vaccine_seasonal.

## Summary
### Insights
- There were more respondents who received seasonal vaccine than the h1n1 vaccine.
- The behavioral traits can influence individual's decisions to receive the seasonal vaccine more than h1n1 vaccine.
- Recommendations from doctors - have a significant influence on respondent's decisions to receive the vaccine.

### Recommendations
With the predictive model, health practitioners can target the community members who are less likely to receive the H1N1 or seasonal vaccines. They can do so through
various approaches, such as
- Conducting awareness campaigns to promote healthy behaviors
- Collaborating with doctors to recommend vaccinations to those individuals.
